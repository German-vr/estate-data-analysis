## 📌 Overview

This project is a personal exploration of real estate and customer data. Using Python for preprocessing and analysis, and Tableau for visualization, it aims to identify trends in sales, customer demographics, and building types. While the approach is structured and the results are data-driven, this is a pet project and not intended for professional or commercial use.

## 🎯 Objectives

This analysis seeks to understand the customer profile and building characteristics by answering the following questions:

- Which customer age bracket has the greatest buying potential?
- What is the most sought-after building type?
- Which building type has the highest price?
